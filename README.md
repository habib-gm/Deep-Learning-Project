## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment or emotion conveyed in a piece of text. This notebook focuses on sentiment analysis using a custom dataset containing happy and sad sentiments.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python 3.x and the required dependencies installed. Here are the installation steps:

1. Clone the repository:
        `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git`
   
3. Change the directory to the cloned repository:
         `cd sentiment-analysis`

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for sentiment analysis consists of two categories: happy and sad. The notebook provides code to split the dataset into train, test, and validation sets, and perform necessary transformations on the images.

The dataset is stored in the following directory structure:

working/ <br /> 
├── train/ <br />
│ ├── happy/ <br />
│ ├── sad/ <br />
├── test/ <br />
│ ├── happy/ <br />
│ ├── sad/ <br />
├── validation/ <br />
│ ├── happy/ <br />
│ ├── sad/  <br />


## Model Training

The notebook uses PyTorch to train a neural network model for sentiment analysis. It includes code for defining the model architecture, setting up data loaders, and training the model using the training set.

## Evaluation

After training the model, the notebook evaluates its performance on the validation set. It calculates accuracy and other metrics to assess the model's effectiveness in sentiment analysis.
